# Master-Thesis--Interpretable-Deep-Canonical-Correlation-Analysis-Based-Neural-Networks
It focuses on the topic of Multi-view Data Analysis, using machine learning to analyse image data. Specifically, CCA family of algorithms to find the optimal projection with the maximal correlation among the multi-view data. Moreover using the deep network visualization techniques to analyse the overfitting problem in this experienment.
